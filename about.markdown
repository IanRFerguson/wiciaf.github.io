## Research
--------------
The primary focus of my research is to examine interpersonal connections as a valuable resource for increasing upward social mobility, combating psychological and material barriers. I aim to integrate social and behavioral science research into policy and practice.

## Outside of Academia
---------------
My non-academic goals include writing and illustrating a children's book, going whale watching in Alaska, and living on a farm (but just for a little while).
